                    Jay brings authentic Thai healing traditions from Northeastern Thailand, a region renowned for its traditional massage techniques passed down through generations. Having relocated to the UK in 2007, she has spent 18 years perfecting her craft whilst maintaining the cultural authenticity that makes Thai massage so uniquely therapeutic.
